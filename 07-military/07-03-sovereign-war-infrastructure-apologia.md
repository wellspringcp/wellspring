# Wellspring: Sovereign War Infrastructure Constitutional Law: Apologia

## Procuring and renting natureses under binding agreements upon the tenant to build the required infrastructure

To expound further on this constraint, here are some examples of how it might be effectuated in practice:

- If a dam must be built, `SovWI` should prefer to reserve and purchase the land and river-course natureses and rent them out, and put out a public tender contract for the construction and maintenance of a dam on those natureses contingent on the condition that the contract awardee will also bind itself to service-level agreement contracts and other legally binding agreements with the government to ensure the dam meets whatever parameters war-readiness requires.
- If a telecommunications bearer backbone network must be constructed, `SovWI` should prefer a similar approach, purchasing the title to the natureses along the distance the network infrastructure will cover, and then renting them out using public tender contracts and binding the awardee to meet the service level constraints required for war-readiness.
