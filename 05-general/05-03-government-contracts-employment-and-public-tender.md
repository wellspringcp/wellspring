# Wellspring: Government contracts and public tender:

There shall be no public sector unions. This shall not be construed to mean that government employees and contractors may not unionize and pursue collective and litigative action against government using negotiation and private sector mechanisms.

> [Experimental]: When the govt wishes to procure labour it shall bid at a competitive market price. The labourer shall have the right to walk away from a poorly remunerated govt job without notice. This should incentivize govt to overcompensate with generous salaries to retain contractors, and to structure contracts carefully to ensure ongoing supervision of deliverables.
