# Wellspring general governing laws:

## Externality Exchange Auction

### Purpose

This service shall be provided by the Informative branch of government and funded by taxes and service fees/commissions to inform the economy of services which have effectual demand but have externality properties. It shall also be the benchmark for market rate when needed for government references and the mechanism for coordinating relief in the event of natural disasters.

All property expropriated by government as a result of court judgments shall be listed on this auction in the format best suited to maximize revenue after a reasonable time has passed, and only if there is no ongoing legal dispute over the property.

### Natural disasters

When a natural disaster does occur, the Informative branch shall ensure that it deploys proactive agents to the area to take continuous surveys of the demand for goods and services and ensure that they get listed on the Externality Exchange Auction so that opportunistic, profit-seeking entrepreneurs can be informed of what is in demand for reconstruction and bring their capitals to bear on the locale of the disaster quickly.

Government shall have no power to impose price controls on the supply of products and services to/within a disaster zone.

When a natural disaster does occur, the Judicial branch and police shall rapidly set up emergency courts and police presence in the disaster zone to quickly establish a court presence for efficiently dealing with instances of fraud, robbery, etc. The judicial branch shall deploy proactive agents to the locale of the disaster and establish a visible, ubiquitous presence to anticipate and take on new lawsuits and claims. Note that these proactive judicial agents are merely for filing papers into the emergency courts, and not for conducting judicial processes or producing judgments.

These active emergency government measures shall gradually be phased out as the disaster area is restored to regular working order. 

Conagents living in a particular natures area should take knowledge of the climate and weather patterns in that area and should both pay for insurance against natural disasters common to that area, and build their domiciles appropriately to meet the challenges of that area. Government shall not subsidize the costs of construction and development in areas where independent actors would not otherwise build/settle/operate.
