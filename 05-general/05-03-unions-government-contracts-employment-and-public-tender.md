# Wellspring: Unions, government contracts and public tender:

# Unions:

*There are mechanisms provided elsewhere in this constitution to promote and ensure workplace health and safety.*

## Public sector union legislation:

*Nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that government employees and contractors may not unionize and pursue collective and litigative action against, or negotiation with, government. This section merely prevents the establishment of forced union obligations via legislation.*

There shall be no legislation which forces any association (or dissociation) amongst individuals or between individuals and any organization/union. The freedom both to associate and to dissociate shall not be infringed by government. 

## Private sector union legislation:

*Nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that government employees and contractors may not unionize and pursue collective and litigative action against, or negotiation with, employers. This section merely prevents the establishment of forced union obligations via legislation.*

There shall be no legislation to force any private individuals/entities to associate or interact. The freedom both to associate and to dissociate shall not be infringed by government. The following non-exhaustive list of attempts to use government to force association/interaction shall be unenforceable:

- Attempts, via legislation, to force employers to associate or interact with unions.
- Attempts, via legislation, to force employees to join or pay dues to unions.

# Government contracts and public tender:

> [Experimental]: When the govt wishes to procure labour it shall bid at a competitive market price. The labourer shall have the right to walk away from a poorly remunerated govt job without notice. This should incentivize govt to overcompensate with generous salaries to retain contractors, and to structure contracts carefully to ensure ongoing supervision of deliverables.
