# Wellspring: Unions, government contracts and public tender:

# Unions:

*There are mechanisms provided elsewhere in this constitution to promote and ensure workplace health and safety.*

## Public sector union legislation:

*Nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that government employees and contractors may not unionize and pursue collective and litigative action against, or negotiation with, government. This section merely prevents the establishment of forced union obligations via legislation.*

There shall be no legislation which forces any association (or dissociation) amongst individuals or between individuals and any organization/union. The freedom both to associate and to dissociate shall not be infringed by government. 

## Private sector union legislation:

*Nothing in this section shall be construed to mean that government employees and contractors may not unionize and pursue collective and litigative action against, or negotiation with, employers. This section merely prevents the establishment of forced union obligations via legislation.*

There shall be no legislation to force any private individuals/entities to associate or interact. The freedom both to associate and to dissociate shall not be infringed by government. The following non-exhaustive list of attempts to use government to force association/interaction shall be unenforceable:

- Attempts, via legislation, to force employers to associate or interact with unions.

# Government contracts and public tender:

All government contracts shall be listed on the public Externality Exchange auction unless by their nature, doing so would violate the `SovWI` War Secret legislation. Government may impose extra interview steps or qualification rounds in the process of public tender in order to satisfy other requirements, but all such extra qualification rounds must be publicly published beforehand; and the initial pool of applicants shall be those obtained via the Externality Exchange auction listing.
