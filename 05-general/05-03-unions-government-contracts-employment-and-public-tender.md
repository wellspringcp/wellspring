# Wellspring: Unions, government contracts and public tender:

# Unions:

## Public sector union legislation:

There are mechanisms provided elsewhere in this constitution to promote and ensure workplace health and safety.

Nothing in this section shall not be construed to mean that government employees and contractors may not unionize and pursue collective and litigative action against government. This section merely prevents the establishment of forced union obligations via legislation.

There shall be no legislation which forces any association (or dissociation) amongst individuals, or between individuals and the government (aside from court orders).

## Private sector union legislation:

There shall be no legislation to force any private individuals/entities to have to associate or interact. The freedom both to associate and to dissociate shall not be infringed by government. The following non-exhaustive list of attempts to use government to force association/interaction shall be unenforceable:

- Attempts to force employers to associate or interact with unions.
- Attempts to force employees to join or pay dues to unions.

# Government contracts and public tender:

> [Experimental]: When the govt wishes to procure labour it shall bid at a competitive market price. The labourer shall have the right to walk away from a poorly remunerated govt job without notice. This should incentivize govt to overcompensate with generous salaries to retain contractors, and to structure contracts carefully to ensure ongoing supervision of deliverables.
