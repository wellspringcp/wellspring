# Wellspring suffrage: Apologia

## Eligibility to vote:

We want to ensure that all indepagents which labour and pay taxes (or natures rents which make up taxes) for a particular term, are eligible to vote to control the policies and offices which influence the labour they perform over such a term. It stands to reason that people who pay taxes should have controlling say in how that money is spent.

### Agency

Since only taxpayers can qualify to vote, and only individual indepagents may be taxed, it stands to reason that corpagents should not be able to vote.

### Termed offices

For example, to qualify to vote for a 4-year termed office, one must have made tax payments on income covering at least 3 out of the last 4 years.

### Constitutional amendments:

As Antonin Scalia said of constitutional amendment: "It ought to be hard, but not too hard". Another way of putting it is that a republic is meant to be rule of law, not rule by the will of the times. Achieving that balance is diffcult. We take heart that where changes are desired by an overwhelming majority, they are usually made through the constitutional amendment process -- and where necessary they are made by force of even civil war.

We chose this eligibility criteria to ensure that there was a minimum number of years over which a person must have been productive within the economy, before they take it upon themselves to vote to change the way the economy works. In addition, we want to ensure that a person who votes on a constitutional amendment has laboured within the economy relatively *recently* before they deign to know what changes it requires - so someone who worked 15 years and then spent the last 20 years living outside of `WS` won't fly in and vote to control an economy s/he probably is no longer intimately acquainted with.
