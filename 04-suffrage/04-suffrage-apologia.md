# Wellspring suffrage: Apologia

## Eligibility to vote:

We want to ensure that all indepagents which labour and pay taxes (or natures rents which make up taxes) for a particular term, are eligible to vote to control the policies and offices which influence the labour they perform over such a term. It stands to reason that people who pay taxes should have a say in how those taxes are spent. By implication, people who do not pay taxes should have no say in the spending of money that is not theirs.

### Agency

 Only individuals may be taxed anyway, so since only taxpayers can qualify to vote, it stands to reason that corpagents should not be able to vote.

### Terms offices

### Constitutional amendments:

As Antonin Scalia said of constitutional amendment: "It ought to be hard, but not too hard". Another way of putting it is that a republic is meant to be rule of law, not rule by the will of the times. Achieving that balance is diffcult. We take heart that where changes are desired by an overwhelming majority, they are usually made through the constitutional amendment process -- and where necessary they are made by force of even civil war.
