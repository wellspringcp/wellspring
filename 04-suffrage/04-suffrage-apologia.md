# Wellspring suffrage: Apologia

## Eligibility to vote:

## Qualifying Natureses

For practical purposes, it is really only expected that land and waterways will ever be on this list. But if for example, it becomes trendy to build and dwell subterraneously, or to live in hovering cities in the sky, it might become necessary to update the list.

We want to ensure that all indepagents which labour and pay taxes (or natures rents which make up taxes) for a particular term, are eligible to vote to control the policies and offices which influence the labour they perform over such a term.

For indepagents which labour but don't pay rent, they have voluntarily given up their vote.

### Agency

### Terms offices

### Constitutional amendments:

As Antonin Scalia said of constitutional amendment: "It ought to be hard, but not too hard". Another way of putting it is that a republic is meant to be rule of law, not rule by the living. Achieving that balance is diffcult. We take heart that where changes are desired by an overwhelming majority, they are usually made through the constitutional amendment process -- and where necessary they are made by force of even civil war.
