# Wellspring: Suffrage

## Eligibility to vote

Eligibility to vote is purpose-specific. Indepagents may be eligible to vote for one thing while being ineligible to vote for another.

### Agency

Only indepagents may vote. Corporations/legal persons shall not be able to cast votes.

### Termed offices

An indepagent shall be eligible to vote for a particular termed office if they have tax receipts covering at least 75% of the duration of the previous term of that office. The receipts need not be contiguous.

[Move this example into the apologia]
- E.g., to qualify to vote for a 4-year termed office, one must have tax receipts covering at least 3 out of the last 4 years.

### Constitutional amendments

An indepagent shall be eligible to vote on a constitutional amendment if they have tax receipts covering at least 10 out of the last 30 years; the receipts need not be contiguous.

[Give examples in the apologia]
