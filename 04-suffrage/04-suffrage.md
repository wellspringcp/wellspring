## Eligibility to vote

Eligibility to vote is not linked to citizenship. Citizenship is a different mechanism with a different purpose. Non-citizens who are resident or domiciled may vote, if eligible.

Eligibility to vote is purpose-specific. Indepagents may be eligible to vote for one thing while being ineligible to vote for another.

Eligibility to vote is based on:
1. Being fully paid up on taxes (i.e, no outstanding balance).
2. Having been a net positive and non-zero taxpayer for some specified fraction of the previous term of the office or decision being voted on.

The government may use its records of taxation to validate voter eligibility. The government shall provide receipts for taxes upon request.

### Agency

Only indepagents may vote. Fictagents shall not be able to cast votes. Government shall have no authority to impose penalties for not voting.

### Termed offices

An indepagent shall be eligible to vote for a particular termed office if they have earned income streams for at least 75% of the duration of the previous term of that office, and have no outstanding tax debt on any of their income streams. The stints of earning need not be contiguous.

### Constitutional updates

An indepagent shall be eligible to vote on a constitutional amendment/update if they have earned income streams for at least 15 out of the last 30 years, and have no outstanding tax debt on any of their income streams. The stints of earning need not be contiguous.
