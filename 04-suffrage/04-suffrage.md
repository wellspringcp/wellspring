## Eligibility to vote

Eligibility to vote is not linked to citizenship. Citizenship is a different mechanism with a different purpose. Non-citizens who are resident or domiciled may vote, if eligible.

Eligibility to vote is purpose-specific. Indepagents may be eligible to vote for one thing while being ineligible to vote for another.

Eligibility to vote is based on:
1. Being fully paid up on taxes (i.e, no outstanding balance).
2. Having been a taxpayer for some specified fraction of the previous term of the office or decision being voted on.

The government shall provide receipts for taxes upon request. The government may use its records of taxation to validate eligibility.

### Agency

Only indepagents may vote. Corpagents shall not be able to cast votes.

### Termed offices

An indepagent shall be eligible to vote for a particular termed office if they have fully paid taxes on their income over at least 75% of the duration of the previous term of that office. The stints of earning need not be contiguous.

### Constitutional amendments

An indepagent shall be eligible to vote on a constitutional amendment if they have fully paid taxes on their income over at least 15 out of the last 25 years; the stints of earning need not be contiguous.
