# Wellspring: Environmental lawsuit bounty:

Government shall have the power to levy an additional charge on the amount awarded from nuisance lawsuits in excess of the principle award amount, not exceeding 15% of the award value. This tax shall be levied on the defendant if they lose. The Constitution recommend that such levies be heavier on environmental nuisance suits. {15% was chosen because a heavier levy may stunt the offender's ability to nimbly shift its behaviour to cease being an environmental nuisance.}

Government shall, in order to incentivize environmental lawsuits, offer a share of such tax revenue to the plaintiffs, or other such incentives to generate revenue and protect the environment.

Moreover to protect individual liberty against the myriad bogeymen that arise in every age, each proclaimed an urgent, existential threat by its devotees (who always elevate such causes to a holy mandate); all supposedly collective crises shall be quantified as property damages and priced onto the parties inflicting the damage via the courts.

Such exigencies are only crises if they portend damage to life or property, so the damage must be quantifiable in a private property model. Crises whose damages can't be pinned on human perpetrators, can't be attributed to human action. Like natural disasters, humans will have to adapt to them as private individuals, like all uncertainty. Adaptation may include inconveniences like relocation and re-architecting infrastructure to withstand risks.
