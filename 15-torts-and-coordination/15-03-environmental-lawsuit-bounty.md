# Wellspring: Environmental lawsuit bounty:

Government shall have the power to levy an additional charge relative to the amount awarded from nuisance lawsuits, not exceeding a legislatively defined percentage (15% is the recommended starting value) of the total award value. This charge shall be levied on the defendant if they lose. The Constitution recommend that such levies be heavier on environmental nuisance suits. Government shall, in order to incentivize environmental lawsuits, pay that extra levy to the winning plaintiff(s).

Moreover to protect individual liberty against the myriad bogeymen that arise in every age, each proclaimed an urgent, existential threat by its devotees; all supposedly collective crises shall be quantified as property damages and priced onto the parties inflicting the damage via the courts.

Such exigencies are only crises if they portend damage to human life or property, so the damage must be quantifiable in a private property model. Crises whose damages can't be pinned on human perpetrators, can't be attributed to human action. As with natural disasters, humans will have to adapt to them as private individuals, like all uncertainty. Adaptation may include inconveniences like relocation and re-architecting infrastructure to withstand risks, as it always has.
