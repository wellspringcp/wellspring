# Wellspring: Tenancy Health and Safety:

We basically want to duplicate the workplace health and safety mechanisms and burden of proof in here, but for building health and tenancy (tenancy here as a concept extends to such things as being warded in hospital, hotels, etc.. Healthy buildings are a good thing, and placing the burden of due diligence on the landlord to provide methods of maintaining building health is superior to demanding that )
