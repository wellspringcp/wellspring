# Wellspring: Principles.

## Prologue

This constitution is a broad template of sorts which is meant to be adapted and adopted by a new era of nations. Its name is `Wellspring` -- it aims to be a wellspring from which oases of reason, reality, egoism and individualism will flourish in a world of collectivism and coercion.

Wellspring, hereafter "`WS`", exists to improve upon the mistakes of the preceding American republic and form a more perfect union. `WS` is intended to establish a free market, minarchist, constitutional republic (i.e, emphatically **not** a democracy) with a strong bias against wealth redistribution. Where unclear, the text is to be interpreted to favour as little redistribution as possible, preferring always none if that is an option.

## Interpretation

`WS` shall always be interpreted in an originalist fashion consistent with the doctrine of `Antonin Scalia` (1936-2016). In order to assist with its interpretation, each file also includes an Apologia to explain what the authors were thinking at the time of its origination.

## Symbols, celebrations and rituals.
