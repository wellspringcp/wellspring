# Wellspring: Apologia: "Equality" vs "Metaphysical identity" as the foundation for rights.

Wellspring is a constitution meant to govern humans who wish not only to live, but to live **as humans**. Or, in order to anticipate the advent of artificial general intelligence, Wellspring is a constitution intended to govern rational creatures which wish not only to live, but to live as **rational** creatures.

We do not wish to hold captive to our borders, any individual who wishes to live otherwise. If your theory of humankind differs from ours, we welcome you to seek greener pastures in any of the almost two-hundred odd polities which exist to govern humankind as something other than a rational creature.

*Additionally, if you are a Judeo-Christian believer or a secularist, we make special appeals to you further down in this document which we hope you will find it edifying to read.*

## What is the metaphysically characteristic nature of humankind? the featherless biped, the social animal or the rational creature?
- Humankind is the rational creature.
- Validate this somehow.

## On "morality":

### Morality for all living things generally:

Morality is a code of behaviour for a particular species of creature which describes the set of actions which promote the life of the creature based on objectively observed facts about its nature. Morality examines and bases itself on the objectively observed facts about (1) the requirements for a creature's survival as well as (2) the holistic total of the essential nature of that creature -- i.e, its *metaphysical identity*.

- A bird requires food to survive. One can tie down a bird's wings and feed it and enable it to survive; but for it to not only live, but to live **as a bird** (i.e, holistically), it must be able to exercise the characteristic capabilities which are bestowed on it by the nature of its species. Until the bird is able to embrace the holistic total of its characteristic nature such as flight, it is living as something less than a bird.
- Likewise a human requires food to survive. One can impound humans, nourish them and thereby enable them to survive; but for humans not only to live, but to live **as humans**, they must be allowed to exercise the characteristically human capabilities which humankind possesses by the nature of our species. Until an individual is able to embrace the holistic total of its nature as a rational creature and make full use of its rational faculty, it is living as something **less than** a human.

Morality consists of a code of behaviour to enable a species to live successfully as **what it is**. Notice that morality does not reference life in a social context -- morality pertains to the code of behaviour which a creature must follow in order to live successfully irrespective of its proximity to other creatures. In fact, a creature's observance of the moral code that sustains its life is **most crucial** when it has no assistance on hand. When there is no physician to heal you, your adherence to an objectively defined moral code becomes even more essential.

### Morality specific to rational creatures such as humans:

For the remainder of this document we will narrow our scope to the philosophy of the morality and rights of rational creatures specifically, such as humans.

## On "rights":

Rights arise when a creature, having a certain objectively required moral code, must pursue that moral code in the presence of other creatures. Rights are the claims  one may make to engage in the actions essential to meet one's moral requirements when one is operating in a social context.

## A word on "Equality"

### Why we must graduate past "Equality" as our foundation for rights:

> [TODO:] Find a way to fit this in: "We have rights because of our metaphysical identity as the rational creature. Our species is capable of grasping and acting in accordance with rational laws -- i.e, we are capable of self-governance -- and that is why unless proven otherwise, we have a right to self-determination. 

In graduating past "equality" as the foundation for individual rights, we will not destroy individual rights, but instead cement them immovable, impregnable and sacrosanct.

A fool could see with the naked eye no two humans are equal and in fact often because people desperately assert it as being true when it is plainly false, it creates room for bigoted groups like racial-nationalists and so on to claim that they have "special wisdom" as a recruitment tool and style themselves a voice of reason and truth against a mainstream current of lies.

### Special appeal to Judeo-Christian believers.

It is important to specifically address the followers of Judeo-Christianity and convince them of an error they have accepted as being part of their bible's code of morality when absolutely **isn't** - we offer an olive branch to the (not insignificant) following of Judeo-Christianity to hopefully make it easier for them to graduate from the "equality" doctrine toward a "morality of life" based on objectively verifiable facts.

#### Does the Judeo-Christian bible actually support equality as the foundation for rights? What does it actually say?

A common bromide is that the Judeo-Christian god "created all men equal" -- curiously, this maxim appears nowhere in the Judeo-Christian bible. The Judeo-Christian moral framework does **not** say that their god created all men equal; rather that he created all men *in his image*. Those are two different statements with different ramifications. Judeo-Christian ethics is modeled not on equality as the impetus for morals, but on the contrary, it states that you should treat your neighbour as yourself because he was made in God's image, and has value in the eyes of his creator **in spite of** inadequacies clearly visible in him; not because he is your equal. Judeo-Christian believers treat the disadvantaged with respect because their god has a purpose for every individual. You are commanded to be like the Bereans - so search diligently and see whether this is so.

"Equality" is actually a humanist ethical foundation. In fact, the Judeo-Christian God **proudly admits that He creates people unequally** in order that when his purpose is fulfilled in a person's life, He (God) might gain even more glory in that He was able to accomplish His purpose through a flawed individual **in spite of** his flaws.

#### Objectivism's "Morality of life" based on the metaphysical identity of humankind is a better approximation of Judeo-Christian morality than "Equality" is.

The Judeo-Christian frameworks of rights asserts the sanctity of human life, stemming from the assertion that humans are created in God's image, and that God has a plan for each human life, and this breaks down in the following way:

- The reverence for humankind's "rights" in Judeo-Christianity start from its assertion about the metaphysical nature of humankind as a species: that every human is an instance of the image of God, and that, God's image being in him/her, that life is sacred.
- Judeo-Christianity then says that humankind, made in God's image, have value to God because He has a purpose for each human; therefore even if a human appears to be deficient to you, you must hold his life sacred because his life has value to God, and you don't know God's purpose for him.
- Furthermore, a human life requires a definite course of action, since there is an objectively verifiable course of action which preserves/promotes human life, and objectively verifiable actions which injure/destroy human life, and Judeo-Christianity commands that one love his neighbour as himself -- or, that one objectively treat one's neighbour in such a way as to ensure that one doesn't engage in courses of action which injure/destroy one's neighbour's life, in the same way that one might do so for oneself.
- In order for a human to fulfill God's purpose for their life, they require freedom both to act for the preservation/promotion of their own life, and freedom to act in pursuit of God's purpose, without interference from other humans or from kings and governments.

The Objectivist framework of rights breaks down in the following, comparable way:

- The Objectivist framework of rights *also* stems from the metaphysical identity of mankind as a species: that humankind as a species has a set of metaphyically common properties, attributes and requirements for life which can be observed and confirmed as objective facts. There is a definite course of action which preserves/promotes human life/flourishing (and that these are moral), and there are observable, objectively verifiable courses of action which destroy it (and that these are immoral).
- Objectivism then says that we can make objective judgments about which actions preserve/promote human life and which destroy it and that human morality consists of a code of action governed by objective knowledge of the definite course of action that preserves/promotes human life.
- In order for a human to pursue his/her requirements for life/flourishing, they require freedom to act in pursuit of that life and flourishing, without interference from other humans or from kings and governments.

We submit to the Judeo-Christian world that this framework of rights is a far stronger approximation of their own God's justification for their rights, than the justification given by the "Equality" framework.

Moreover, we submit for all peoples' evaluation, the objectively observable fact that the assertion of "Equality" is simply untrue on its face to begin with.

### An appeal to non-Judeo-Christians:

In this section we will show how neither "God-given rights" nor "equality" suffice as common, objective legal foundations for human rights. A legal rights philosphy must be evident to all within a polity before all can be expected to subordinate their minds to it. Note that `WS` does not opine on whether or not a god exists; it merely points out that, in a polity where multiple world views exist (including atheists):

- "God-given rights" cannot act as a shared legal foundation for rights, since many people do not believe in a god, and those who do, don't agree on which god's commandments should be the objective standard for morality.
- "Equality" cannot act as a shared legal foundation for rights, since any rational person who observes the world around them can see that humans are not in fact, equal.

An objective morality is the only morality which can justly govern mankind.

### A better way - a New Ideal to serve as the foundation for rights:

Our metaphysical nature as a species is a stronger bedrock and foundation for objective rights and morality than either of the traditional theories of rights - especially because it is not merely a theory, but rather a set of observable, objectively verifiable facts. There is no harm in acknowledging that we are not equal. The fabric of our defense of the rights of the individual will not come undone because there is an even **better**, objective foundation for rights waiting buttress it.

This more solid foundation is The New Ideal - the morality of life.
