# Wellspring: Bill of procedural protections:

`WS` recognizes, fundamentally, the right to life and as a corollary, it enforces private property sovereignty. In `WS` all actions are permitted unless explicitly disallowed by this constitution or legislation (and all legislation must follow this constitution).

This bill of procedural protections does not enumerate a fixed list of rights but rather an inexhaustive list of principles which have been discovered to be essential to preserving the sovereignty of the individual before the courts when conducting the common law process. Your right is the right to your own life and property (both cognitive and physical). This document does not grant you rights. Your rights are corollaries of your metaphysical identity as a rational creature. This document merely specifies procedural protections at common law.

This is not a bill of rights. This is a bill of procedural protections before the common law.

## The Forerunning Amendments:

>[Apologia]: On 5th: There is no such thing as "substantive due process".
>[Apologia]: On 5th: 
>[Apologia]: On 7th: Idk how, but make it extremely clear that all trials are to be trials by jury. Somehow in the present day, there are non-jury trials in the USA for sums exceeding $20, so this must mean that somehow, the 7th amendment wasn't clear enough to people. I'm not sure which part was unclear, but clearly some part of it was certainly unclear.
>[Note]: On 12th: "Citizenship" is a tenuous concept in `WS` and we may need to massage this phrasing.

    - All executors of such warrants shall fully securely discard any data not relevant to remit of the warrant **in real time and with immediate effect** as soon as such data is capable of being determined to be irrelevant to the warrant's remit; and shall securely invalidate all such data from all levels of all caches **in real time and with immediate effect** at the same time such determination is made.
6. No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising under the jurisdiction of the `SovWI` courts, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property (both cognitive and physical), without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use except as specified under the `SovWI` law, subject to the published war readiness plan.
