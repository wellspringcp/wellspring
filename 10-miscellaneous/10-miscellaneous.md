## Possession of private weaponry

The `WS` population has a need to be able to capture and kill or enslave outlaws. The purpose of the outlawing penalty is ultimately to make outlaws subject to the dominion of their fellows according to their fellows' whims. If a politician or other person who has been outlawed has access to formidable armaments or defenses, this would render outlawing ineffective as a deterrent and punishment.

In `WS`, private possession of arms is intended to keep pace with the known and provable (by balance of probability of evidence) defensive or offensive capabilities of politicians. I.e, the purpose of private weaponry is not to overthrow the government, but to individually overpower politicians and bring them to heel when outlawed.

We can accomplish this either by:
(1) Allowing politicians freedom to possess (or rent/hire) unlimited weapons and defenses, and then allowing private individuals to sue to establish the minimum level of private weapons capability required to, without failure, subdue a politician.
(2) Restricting politicians to only employ the defenses of the public police force.
(3) Enabling politicians to define a uniform security force funded by govt for their protection (e.g, secret service in the usa), with well known weapons and defense capability and policy, and making the limit on private weapons possession be whatever level of capability is required to subdue that publicly defined security force's capabilities in the pursuit of an outlawed politician.

The 3rd option is eminently superior so that is what we have chosen since it makes it crystal clear what level of private arms possession is needed, and therefore what the legal basis for private arms regulation should be; as well as ensuring that politicians will never become rogue silos of amassed arms. [Define how we should control the soldiers and keep the military subordinate to politics.]
