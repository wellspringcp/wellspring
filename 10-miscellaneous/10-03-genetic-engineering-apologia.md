# Wellspring: Genetic engineering: Apologia

## Germ line editing:

We fully privatize it and don't allow people to modify species which they cannot fully privatize and control and keep restricted to their own private property. For example, you can modify your dog as long as you can demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that you can track, label and geo-restrict it, but not mosquitoes unless you can satisfy these criteria, which is likely very hard to do. We place the burden of proof on the modifier and owner to prove that they can in fact, contain the modified creature and its progeny **beyond reasonable doubt**

The same for crops/plants: no germ line editing which you cannot prove you can contain to your own farm/greenhouse (vertical farming may be a boon here since it might be easier to demonstrate containment beyond a reasonable doubt.).
