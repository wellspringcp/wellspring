# Wellspring: Genetic engineering:

Fully privatize it: don't allow people to modify species which they cannot fully privatize and control and keep restricted to their own private property. For example, you can modify your dog, but not mosquitoes. Place the burden of proof on the modifier and owner to prove that they can in fact, contain the modified creature and its progeny, and also ban germ line editing in those creatures.
The same for crops/plants: no germ line editing which you cannot prove you can contain to your own farm/greenhouse (vertical farming is a boon here).
