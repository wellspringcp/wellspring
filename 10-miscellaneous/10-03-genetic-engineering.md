# Wellspring: Genetic engineering:

## Somatic cell editing:

Somatic cells can be edited without restriction, as long as the activity does not constitute a Non-Ameliorable Harmful Activity (`NAHA`) as defined elsewhere in this constitution.

## Germ line editing:

All germ-line editing is automatically classified as being a `NAHA` **by default** and the burden of proof that it is not a `NAHA` rests on the entity producing the specimen. Furthemore the conagent engaging in the activity must demonstrate that **all** descendants of their germ-line edited specimen can be completely tracked, labeled and kept within the confines of their own private property **beyond reasonable doubt**.
