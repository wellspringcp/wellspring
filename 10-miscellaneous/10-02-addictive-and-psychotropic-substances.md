# Wellspring: Addictive and psychotropic substance laws

All addictive substances have the property of needing some counselling and guidance program to aid the addicted individual in managing and possibly overcoming their addiction. To that end, the `WS` constitution has already granted all such businesses heavy tax discounts to increase their profit margins and ensure they will always be in abundant supply.

The second problem is those psychotropic drugs which increase threats of violence. We make it illegal to go into public while actively under the influence of such a substance. To wit, one may possess such a substance, even brandish and sell it in public, but the consumption thereof in public, or the movement in public while under the influence of such a substance is illegal.

This simply means that if one intends to get inebriated, one should plan in advance not to leave the house/party/wherever until one is sober. And it implies that the owner/manager of the place where the substance is consumed, accepts the risk of damage to his property posed by the inebriated person. If s/he doesn't, then s/he should be careful not to let persons onto his property who are in possession of substances, or to kick them out/call the police to escort them away.

The penalty for being out in public while inebriated is arrest, and escorting home by the police, or if the police are unable to determine the home domicile of the person, to a holding centre until the person is sober, at which point they are free to leave.

By combining widely available, and cheap counselling services with a policy that discourages people from going out into public while inebriated, we reduce the likelihood of violent 3rd party effects, while also making available paths to weaning oneself off addictive substances. No addictive/psychotropic substance may be made illegal. Special taxes however, may be applied only to those substances which have a tendency to increase the likelihood of violence. The revenue from such taxes shall assist in the maintenance of the detainment centres.
