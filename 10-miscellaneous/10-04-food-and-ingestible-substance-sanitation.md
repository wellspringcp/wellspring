# Wellspring: Food safety:

In order to ensure that all food and ingestible substance production, warehousing/storage and distribution/vending is done in a sanitary manner, we provide a legal mechanism to enable customers to inspect the facilities used to produce and/or store and distribute ingestible substances. Where evidence is found of unsanitary operation, we provide equitable remedies to enforce desirable behaviour.

## Warrant: Sanitation Inspection warrant:

### Standing and burden of proof:

Any customer who has purchased an ingestible substance from a producer, warehouser or distributor/vendor shall have standing to seek a warrant against that producer/warehouser/distributor/vendor. The burden of proof required to apply for this warrant is legislatively defined. It is entirely intentional that companies may purchase from their competitors in order to invoke this mechanism against them.

### Powers:

This warrant grants the possessor the right to enter into the premises of a facility and search all areas and equipment/machinery which are used to store the materials for and/or produce an ingestible substance which is offered for sale; and to enlist the aid of law enforcement toward this end if need be. The executor of the warrant may gather such evidence as proves an unsanitary production/storage process.

Upon finding such evidence, the executor has recourse in the courts to a cause of action known as the "Unsanitary ingestible substance facility".

### 

## Cause of action: "Unsanitary Ingestible Substance Facility":

### Burden of proof:

The plaintiff must show according to a legislatively defined burden of proof, of unsanitary storage, or an unsanitary process.
