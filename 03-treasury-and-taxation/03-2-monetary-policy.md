# Monetary policy

Increases in the money supply shall be nought but a consequence of the deficit spending of those branches which are authorized to deficit spend.

Any politician who brings any bill before the legislature which would cause the minting of government issued currency to be accompanied by a debt shall become an outlaw 30 minutes after being found guilty of doing so.
