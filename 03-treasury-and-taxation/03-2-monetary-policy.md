# Monetary policy

Shall be nought but a consequence of military spending. No military spending shall be undertaken with the purpose of acting as a currency supply control. However, the military budget will act as the means of expanding the  currency supply. If the population of the polity increases to the extent that increases in currency supply are needed, the government should then need new police and soldiers,  so the problem solves itself, since the number of soldiers and policemen should scale to cover the population size. So hiring new soldiers and purchasing military assets for readiness to meet the needs of a particular population size should serve as a stand-in for money supply management.

Any politician found guilty of introducing a bill to parliament which would establish a formal monetary control entity in government shall become an outlaw after 15 minutes. Monetary policy shall be a side effect of military budgeting, without negotiation.
