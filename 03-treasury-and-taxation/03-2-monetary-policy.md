# Monetary policy

Increases in the money supply shall be nought but a consequence of the deficit spending of those branches which are authorized to deficit spend.

> [Experimental]: No military spending shall be undertaken with the express purpose of acting as a currency supply control.

Any politician found guilty of introducing a bill to parliament which would establish a formal monetary control entity in government shall become an outlaw after 15 minutes. Monetary policy shall be a side effect of the deficit spending of those branches with the power to deficit spend, without exception.
