# Monetary policy

Increases in the money supply shall be nought but a consequence of military, CBio and Right to Leave program spending. However, the military budget will act as the means of expanding the  currency supply. If the population of the polity increases to the extent that increases in currency supply are needed, the government should then need new police and soldiers,  so the problem solves itself, since the number of soldiers and policemen should scale to cover the population size. So hiring new soldiers and purchasing military assets for readiness to meet the needs of a particular population size should serve as a stand-in for money supply management.

Any politician found guilty of introducing a bill to parliament which would establish a formal monetary control entity in government shall become an outlaw after 15 minutes. Monetary policy shall be a side effect of the deficit spending of those branches with the power to deficit spend, without negotiation.

> [Problem]: Other branches of government will need to erect buildings and purchase natureses from time to time. Perhaps an Estate Management branch of government might be necessary.
