# Wellspring taxation

## Basics

### Valid forms of taxation
`WS` only allows the levying of taxes directly on owners of natureses because in taxing natures owners, one taxes all indepagents who live off that natures. No other form of taxation is allowed. In addition, as an explicit addendum, no forms of excise or internal checkpoint tax on freight or trade shall be levied.

All taxes on wealth instead of income shall be **unenforceable**.

### Upper limit on taxation

No landlord shall be taxed more heavily than at 10% of the income generated per unit of his natureses. All taxation exceeding this shall be **unenforceable**.

## Incentives via tax discounts

Ambiguously purposed natures units shall be deemed to be allocated toward the more heavily taxed purpose.

There shall be a "heavy" tax discount on all rental income from natureses hosting **insurers** for services in private security and investigation, legal aid, healthcare, bank depositors, pension funds and legal aid to ensure that such insurers have preferential allocation by natures owners. Note that this is for the **insurers** for those products/services; not the suppliers of those products/services.

There shall be a "medium" tax discount on all rental income from natureses hosting therapy/counselling services for persons addicted to addictive/psychotropic substances and for the operation of waste collection/sorting/resale companies (**NOT** manufacturers which use resold materials).

There shall be a "light" tax discount on all rental income from natureses purposed for schooling and education.

There shall be a "negligible" tax discount for all land hosting a non-profit corporation. The tax authority shall have the power to audit non-profit organizations to determine whether or not they fit the legal definition of non-profit.

## No deceptive illusions.

Government employees shall be paid directly what the net sum of their salary is and their salary streams from the government shall not be subjected to taxation after they receive it. There shall be NO abstract deception created by the government to make it seem as if government employees pay taxes on their government salary streams. Gov't employees are tax **receivers** and not tax payers. They are employees of the people and in **no way** shall things **ever** be misconstrued to appear as if they are not.
