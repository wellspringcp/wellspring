# Wellspring taxation

## Basics

### Valid forms of taxation
`WS` only allows the levying of taxes directly on the income streams of individual indepagents. No other form of taxation is allowed. Taxing depagents is not allowed: depagents' activities are merely reification of the will of their owning indepagent.

In addition, as explicit prohibitions for the sake of completeness:
- No forms of excise or internal checkpoint tax on freight or trade shall be levied.
  - This shall not be construed to limit `SovWI`'s ability to use checkpoints (without accompanying taxes) for internal security.
  - This shall not be construed to limit the ability of private conagents to charge tolls and other fees for the use of their capitals.
- No taxes shall be levied on wealth instead of income.
  - Any politician found guilty of introducing a bill to pursue a tax on wealth shall become an outlaw after 2 hours.
- No taxes shall be levied on abstract entities such as "corporations", etc.
  - This shall not be construed to prevent the legislature from creating and governing such fictional legal entities as "corporations".

#### Evasion:

> [Apologia]: We cannot allow people to opt out of funding the courts and army because this would compromise the monpoly enjoyed by private property law.
> [Apologia]: At the end of the day, when a conagent enter the jurisdiction of `WS`, it accepts at minimum, without any offer of redress, to be governed by private property law. If they prefer not to accept this, then they are not compelled to come.
> [Apologia]: Since taxation cannot be avoided or made voluntary (beyond the Right to Leave), conagents should be wary to carefully control the tax rate and to guard against any attempts by the legislature to expand taxation beyond an individual income tax.

Evasion shall not be criminalized or carry criminal penalties. Notwithstanding, should an indepagent present itself to court on either side of the advocacy without having its taxes paid: in any proceeding against it where it stands as a defendant, judgment shall proceed against it by default, and in any proceeding where it appears as a plaintiff, its plea shall not be recognized.

- Nevertheless, the police shall continue to provide immediate protection of the physical person of that indepagent and its depagents.
- Indepagents that don't pay their taxes shall be free to leave and shall not suffer imprisonment or any other criminal penalty.

### Upper limit on taxation

No landlord shall be taxed more heavily than at 10% of the income generated per unit of his natureses. All taxation exceeding this shall be **unenforceable**.

## Incentives via tax discounts

If any indepagent wishes to claim the tax discounts outlined in this section on any of its income streams:
- The tax authority shall have the power to audit the corporation (with the consent of the corporation's owners) which is the source of the income stream, to determine whether or not they fall under the umbrella of the category they wish to claim.
- A request for an audit of the corporation shall be made to determine its classification for tax purposes, if such a claim is made.
  - The audit shall not be authorized unless the owner(s) of the corporation consent to be audited.
  - If the audit is not consented to by the corporation, the claim shall be denied.
- Ambiguously purposed income streams shall be deemed to be allocated toward the more heavily taxed purpose, or shall yield no discount if sufficiently ambiguous as to make it unclear that the income stream is primarily purposed toward that discount category.

There shall be a "heavy" tax discount on all income streams from the provision of **insurance** for services in private security and investigation, legal aid, healthcare, bank depositors, pension funds and legal aid to ensure that such insurers have a preferential profit position in the market. Note that this is for the **insurers** for those products/services; not the producers of those products/services.

There shall be a "medium" tax discount on all income streams from the provision of therapy/counselling services for persons addicted to addictive/psychotropic substances and for the operation of waste collection/sorting/resale companies (**NOT** manufacturers which use resold materials).

There shall be a "light" tax discount on all income streams from schooling and education.

There shall be a "negligible" tax discount on all income streams from a non-profit corporation.

## No deceptive illusions.

Government employees shall be paid directly what the net sum of their salary is and their salary streams from the government shall not be subjected to taxation after they receive it. There shall be NO abstract deception created by the government to make it seem as if government employees pay taxes on their government salary streams. Gov't employees are tax **receivers** and not tax payers. They are employees of the people and in **no way** shall things **ever** be misconstrued to appear as if they are not.
