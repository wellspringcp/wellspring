# Wellspring taxation: Apologia

## Basics

### Valid forms of taxation:

We've chosen to directly tax only natures owners because we would like to limit the amount of interaction between the government's tax collectors and the average citizen.

The number, 10%, can obviously be changed by constitutional amendment, obviously - and only by that means.

### Upper limit on taxation:

I hope it's obvious that the prohibition on taxes on wealth also applies to inheritances.
