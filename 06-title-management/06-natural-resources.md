## Natural Resources ("Natureses")

Natural resources as defined by this Constitution includes all naturally occurring assets, from airspace and electromagnetic waves to land to waterways (not an exhaustive list).

All natural resources originally belong to the government. The government shall grant title to such resources to the indepagent which wins the bid for it on the externality auction. Such title may not subsquently be unilaterally withdrawn by the government after it is given out. The government shall however maintain a registry of all such title owners and all transfers of title shall be registered with the government. The government may tax title holders. A title holder may voluntarily relinquish title to an allocated natural resource back to the government at any time.

Since government must track the locations of allocated natureses, it shall have the power to invent and control the polity's addressing scheme for natural resources for consistency. Notwithstanding, private addressing and naming schemes may be layered on top of government's scheme by private legal persons.

All such units of natural resource owned by the government shall be listed on the exchange and sold there. The branches of government shall bid for title to natural resources the same way as all other legal persons and shall have no elevated privileges in the bidding. It is intentional that this may allow acquisition to be gratis.

The sale of natural resources confers ownership of such natural resources in a multi-dimensional manner. For example, in the case of land, the sale should be in units of 3 dimensional cubes of land stretching from the surface to some distance below it, and not from the surface to the center of the earth. This allows another buyer to purchase another stretch of blocks beneath that stretch of blocks owned by the legal person closest to the surface and so on.

The sale of land shall also, if necessary be accompanied by a sale of suffucient airspace if there is to be construction of a structure above ground as well. A structure must be built within the confines of the allocated space purchased by its owner. This enables airlines to purchase routes or rent routes owned by other legal persons and so on, thereby solving co-ordination problems.

A valuable natural treasure contained within a purchased natural resource which was previously undiscovered shall be counted as being part of the containing natural resource and shall incur no additional price on the owner after discovery. Notwithstanding, government shall have the right to modify tax rates at its discretion, subject to applicable laws.

Utopia does not honour title held by or on behalf of foreign govts and/or their agents/agencies except as needed for diplomacy. When expropriating such titles, they shall be listed on the externality auction.
