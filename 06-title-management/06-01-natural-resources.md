# Wellspring: Natural Resources ("Natureses")

Natural resources as defined by this Constitution includes all naturally occurring assets, from airspace and electromagnetic waves to land to waterways (not an exhaustive list).

## Original ownership and allocation:

All natural resources are originally assigned to the custodianship of the government. The government shall grant title to such resources to the indepagent which wins the bid for it on the externality auction. Such title shall not subsquently be unilaterally withdrawn by the government after it is given out. The government shall however maintain a registry of all such title owners and all transfers of title shall be registered with the government. A title holder may voluntarily relinquish title to an allocated natural resource back to the government at any time.

## Sale and transfer of title from government to other entities:

All such units of natural resource under custodianship of government shall be listed on the exchange and sold there. The branches of government shall bid for title to natural resources the same way as all other indepagents and shall have no elevated privileges in the bidding with the sole exception of the Military branch, when acting under the auspices of `SovWI` law. It is intentional that this may allow acquisition to be gratis.

The sale of natural resources confers ownership of such natural resources in a multi-dimensional manner. For example, in the case of land, the sale should be in units of 3 dimensional cubes of land stretching from the surface to some distance below it, and not from the surface to the center of the earth. This allows another buyer to purchase another stretch of blocks beneath that stretch of blocks owned by the indepagent closest to the surface and so on.

The sale of land shall also, if necessary, be accompanied by a sale of sufficient airspace if there is to be construction of a structure above ground as well. A structure must be built within the confines of the allocated space purchased by its owner. This enables airlines to purchase routes or rent routes owned by other legal persons and so on, thereby solving co-ordination problems.

## Explicit mention that taxes on transfer of title are prohibited:

In case the "Taxation" section of this constitution wasn't clear enough for politicians, government shall have no authority to tax the transfer of title to natural resources. The free, easy resale of land is crucial to a free market's ability to ensure land is most profitably and ethically used.

## Addressing and naming schemes:

Since government must track the locations of allocated natureses, it shall have the power to invent and control the polity's addressing scheme for natural resources for consistency. Notwithstanding, private addressing and naming schemes may be layered on top of government's scheme by private legal persons.

Additionally:
- <Experimental>: The `SovHOA` law shall have the power to determine when a particular usage of natures imposes an externality, and requires the accompanying purchase of "buffer" room to sufficiently isolate the natures allotment from surrounding allotments.
  - This power shall never form the basis of an indirect control mechanism to achieve political ends such as a political desire to ban "fracking" or to ban nuclear energy, for example.

## Valuable natural treasures occuring within a natures:

A valuable natural treasure contained within a purchased natural resource which was previously undiscovered shall be counted as being part of the containing natural resource and shall incur no additional price on the owner after discovery.

## Reservation of sovereign prerogative with regards to foreign sovereignty:

`WS` does not honour title held by or on behalf of foreign govts and/or their agents/agencies except as needed for diplomacy. When expropriating such titles, they shall be listed on the externality auction.
