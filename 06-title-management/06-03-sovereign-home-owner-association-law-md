# Wellspring: Sovereign Home Owner Association Law

Sovereign HOA shall not be used as a mechanism for environmental preservation. E.g, they may not be used by the government to preserve a particular river, or bundle restrictions on carbon emission if title to that natures is sold. The government may however, refuse to sell, or may itself purchase certain natureses to preserve historical sites or war readiness.

Changes in Sov HOA law do not apply to current title holders. Current possesors' title contracts are not altered by Sov HOA law changes. For a change in Sov HOA law to apply to a lessee, the natures must be recycled back into and out of the sovereign's ownership.

The sovereign may offer (but may not make the acceptance of such an offer mandatory or attach any penalty to refusal - any such attempt shall be unenforceable) a repurchase agreement to a current lessee in order to rebind that lessee under new SovHOA laws. It is conceivable and intentional that natureses which are governed under different laws may have different market values due to their governing laws.

Obviously however, a fresh purchase of a natures bundles together the most recent SovHOA/SovWI/SovCBio laws.
