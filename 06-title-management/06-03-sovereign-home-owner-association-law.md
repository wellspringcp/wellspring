# Wellspring: Sovereign Home Owner Association Law (`SovHOA`)

## Purpose

`SovHOA` laws are the set of terms upon which the sovereign rents natureses to individuals. They are meant to ensure non-griefing behaviour among owners of natureses and to establish conventions for determining when a natures is owned vs when it is unowned.

`SovHOA` laws shall not be used as a mechanism for environmental preservation. E.g, they may not be used by the government to preserve a particular river, or bundle restrictions on carbon emission if title to that natures is sold. There are mechanisms provided for environmental protection elsewhere in this constitution.

### Non-griefing:

`SovHOA` laws also establish, for each type of natures, what behaviour constitutes griefing.

> [Apologia]: The definition of "griefing" here is the allocation of surrounding natureses which curtails another natures owner's use of their own natures. "Griefing" does not cover activities and behaviour in the use of a natures which has 3rd party effects, and it does not cover trespass. That is the domain of torts and criminal law.

> [Apologia]: E.g, in the case of land, if a person buys a narrow strip of land intended to encompass another person's land and cut them off, so as to entrap them with a charge of trespass, this is a case of griefing in allocation. `SovHOA` anti-griefing laws are intended to preclude griefing in the allocation of natureses; not their use.

### Ownership conventions/Demarcations:

`SovHOA` laws outline the distinctive marks which designate each type of natures as being privately owned (as opposed to un-owned natureses), as well as the locations where publication of ownership of natureses are expected to be, should a distinctive demarcation not be possible for any particular type of natures.

## Binding and versioning:

> [Experimental, unlikely to remain]

Changes in `SovHOA` law do not apply to current title holders. Current possesors' title contracts are not altered by `SovHOA` law changes. For a change in Sov HOA law to apply to a lessee, the natures must be recycled back into and out of the government's ownership.

The government may offer (but may not make the acceptance of such an offer mandatory or attach any penalty to refusal - any such attempt shall be unenforceable) a repurchase agreement to a current title holder in order to rebind that title holder under new `SovHOA` laws. It is conceivable and intentional that natureses which are governed under different laws may have different market values due to their governing laws.

Obviously however, a fresh purchase of a natures bundles together the most recent `SovHOA`/`SovWI`/`SovCBio` laws.
