# Wellspring: Foundations of Natures trespass theory:

All natureses not titled may be freely traveled across by any individual. Though no individual may exercise dominion over them other than in travelling across or through them. Use of any natures shall be via title purchase.

It shall be assumed that natureses not encompassed or otherwise demarcated as private are unsold. Airspace may be demarcated with regularly interspersed beacons or other such means. Radiofrequencies may be demarcated with a commonly agreed upon noise/jamming signal, or other such means.

Legislation shall explicitly recognize the "commonly understood" demarcations, as well as provide reasonable room for those demarcations which are unanticipated.
