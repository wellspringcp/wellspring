# Wellspring: Legislature

## The purpose of legislation:

### Privala bills

The category under which most legislation will fall is the Private Property Law bill (hereafter, `Privala bill`). 

The `WS` constitution already cements private property as the law of the polity. The purpose of laws passed by the legislature is merely make it clear to the polity how private property law (as defined in the "Principles" of this constitution) applies to particular actions, scenarios and innovations and thereby to extend private property's coverage to new phenomena. The goal of legislation is not to "create opportunity" or pursue "equality" or to "regulate".

A privala bill must pass the Legislative Process in order to enter the body of adopted law.

### Advisory standards bills

> [Experimental]

A separate category of legislation, known as "Advisory Standards", exists to enable the legislature to recommend normative codes of behaviour to be ***optionally*** adopted by the private sector as policy for the management of externality-fraught enterprises and enterprises which are difficult to co-ordinate. Advisory Standard Bills must go through the same Legislative Process as `Privala` bills in order to enter the body of Adopted Advisory Standards.

## The legislative process: Incentivizing individualist legislation


A bill may only be submitted to Congress if it references a problem on record, and explains how it plans to solve that problem.

Any law which is passed which as a solution to a defined problem may be challenged at any time by a new bill.

Only one act may control any problem at any given time.

When multiple bills contend in congress as solutions to the same referenced problem, the winning bill shall be that bill which preserves freedom the most, measured in the amount of redistribution, the amount of govt spending and the number of controls on movement, labour, thought, action and expression.

The difference per annum between the least and most free, quantified monetarily, shall be awarded to the drafters, co-sponsors and voting adopters of the bill. Unconstitutional bills shall not be considered in the calculation, and they are subject to the normal outlawing process.

When an existing law is replaced, an award of the same kind shall be granted to the new law's drafters, co-sponsors and voting adopters, with the difference calculated between the old law and the new.

The old block of awardees shall not lose their award. Any awardees who are sponsors of both the old and new bill shall retain the higher of the two awards only.


### Nominating and possibly Recognizing an issue as requiring legislative attention.

When a new law is to be crafted to address some issue, the `issue` must be one that was recognized through the nomination process. No bill law may be passed into law unless it references an `issue on record`. Bills which do not address an `issue on record` shall be unceremoniously thrown out.

#### Nominating an issue

Logically distinct `issues` must be defined and nominated separately. `Issues` must be well defined in scope, and must clearly define the exact private property or co-ordination problem they describe. Congress may not proceed until the `issue` itself is clearly defined.

It is intentional that the question of whether or not the subject of the nominated `issue` even constitutes a problem, will be central to the debate. A subject may look as if it is a problem, but upon closer examination show itself to be a non-issue, which is already addressed by some existing law or private sector mechanism.

#### Technical consultation during nomination.

#### Recognizing an issue

The `issue` will be entered into the `Record of Issues`, and is now called, an `issue on record`.

### Addressing an issue

#### Legislative process.
