# Wellspring: Legislature

## The purpose of legislation:

The `WS` constitution already cements private property as the law of the polity. The purpose of laws passed by the legislature is merely make it clear to the polity how private property law (as defined in the "Principles" of this constitution) applies to particular actions, scenarios and innovations and thereby It is to extend private property's coverage to new phenomena.

> [Apologia]: Legislation's goal is not to "create opportunity" or pursue "equality" or "regulate".
