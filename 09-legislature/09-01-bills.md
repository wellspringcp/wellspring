# Wellspring: Legislature

## Types of bills

### Pripola bills

The category under which most legislation will fall is the Private Property Law Bill category (hereafter, `Pripola bill`). 

The `WS` constitution already cements private property as the law of the polity. The purpose of laws passed by the legislature is merely make it clear to the polity how private property law (as defined in the "Principles" of this constitution) applies to particular actions, scenarios and innovations and thereby to extend private property's coverage to new phenomena. The goal of legislation is not to "create opportunity" or pursue "equality" or to "regulate".

A pripola bill must pass the Legislative Process in order to enter the body of adopted law.

### Advisory standards bills

> [Experimental:] If we keep Advisory standard bills, make sure to write an apologia for why they are useful.

A separate category of legislation, known as "Advisory Standards", exists to enable the legislature to recommend normative codes of behaviour to be ***optionally*** adopted by the private sector as policy for the management of externality-fraught enterprises and enterprises which are difficult to co-ordinate. Advisory Standard Bills must go through the same Legislative Process as `Pripola` bills in order to enter the body of Adopted Advisory Standards.

## Required metrics

### Metrics for effectiveness

All bills must have a set of metrics by which their effectiveness at addressing their targeted `issue on record` can be measured. Every 2 years upon the anniversary of the passing of each bill, the legislature shall review the facts of the bill's performance in the real world, and determine whether it meets its required metrics. Should it fail to meet its metrics, the legislature shall be compelled by legislative procedure to initiate a legislative process to replace the bill with one which properly addresses the `issue on record`. The new bill may, naturally, have new metrics.

### Conditions for relevance

All bills must have a set of conditions listed which state the conditions which exist in the real world, that give occasion for their relevance. Every 4 years upon the anniversary of the passing of each particular bill, the conditions shall be reviewed and the bill shall be assessed for relevance to the real world at the time of review. Obsolete bills shall either be repealed or replaced with an updated bill which is relevant to the real world at the time of review.
