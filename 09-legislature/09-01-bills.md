# Wellspring: Legislature

## The purpose of legislation:

### Pripola bills

The category under which most legislation will fall is the Private Property Law Bill category (hereafter, `Pripola bill`). 

The `WS` constitution already cements private property as the law of the polity. The purpose of laws passed by the legislature is merely make it clear to the polity how private property law (as defined in the "Principles" of this constitution) applies to particular actions, scenarios and innovations and thereby to extend private property's coverage to new phenomena. The goal of legislation is not to "create opportunity" or pursue "equality" or to "regulate".

A pripola bill must pass the Legislative Process in order to enter the body of adopted law.

### Advisory standards bills

> [Experimental:] If we keep Advisory standard bills, make sure to write an apologia for why they are useful.

A separate category of legislation, known as "Advisory Standards", exists to enable the legislature to recommend normative codes of behaviour to be ***optionally*** adopted by the private sector as policy for the management of externality-fraught enterprises and enterprises which are difficult to co-ordinate. Advisory Standard Bills must go through the same Legislative Process as `Pripola` bills in order to enter the body of Adopted Advisory Standards.
