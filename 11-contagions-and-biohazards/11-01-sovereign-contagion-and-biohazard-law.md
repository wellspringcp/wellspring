# Wellspring: Sovereign Contagion and Biohazard Law (`SovCBIO`)

> [TODO: Clarify what "precedence" here means.]
`SovCBio` law takes precedence over `SovWI` law, which takes precedence over `SovHOA` law.

> [Apologia]: Communicable disease is an intrusion of nature on human life. When a disease takes root among a populace, it is not the fault of any human (barring negligence and volitional spreading). The agent that is primarily responsible for disease is nature itself. Except where a disease is spread from one human to another through negligence or volition, the spread of disease is not a human failing. The enemy that causes disease is not human action or inaction (barring negligence and volition), but nature and its impositions on human life.

Through the rigorous application of the scientific method (aka, observation/measurement and reasoning), human agents may identify the nature of the disease and invent methods of controlling and/or curing the disease. When such a human agent does invent a treatment, the culpability for the disease does not suddenly shift from nature to that human agent. Nature remains the root cause of the suffering.

The human agents who go about labouring to invent, manufacture, mass produce, distribute and sell the treatment are merely cleaning up a mess started by nature. Nature has the power to introduce calamnities which are difficult to get under our control. In the moment when a human agent invents a treatment, or participates in the manufacture/distribution/sale of such a treatment, that agent does not suddenly gain a super-human responsibility for ensuring that every individual afflicted with the disease gets access to the treatment. That agent remains human, having only human capabilities, and therefore can only be answerable for the things that a human can do -- and s/he doesn't become answerable for saving everyone.

## Reasons for and principles behind `SovCBIO`:

### Reasons for `SovCBIO`'s necessity: Nature is an unaccountable antagonist to human life.

A free market promises that effectual demand will ***eventually*** be met with profitable supply. Whether the eventuality is realized quickly or slowly is up to the state of reality and the various factors that make it up. In the case of communicable diseases however, especially those which cause non-trivial damage to the body quickly enough to outstrip the pace of research to treat them, it may be justifiable for the government to step in and impose measures to contain the spread of the disease/pestilence/biohazard to ensure that the non-trivial damage caused by the disease is not inflicted on new individuals if it could be contained.

### Principles behind `SovCBIO` law:

The guiding principles for deciding which communicable diseases may require government intervention are these:

## We cannot control nature's impositions of disease, but we can control humans' impositions of disease.

We cannot make nature subject to our human laws and command it to stop inflicting disease on humans. But we can issue laws to human beings and hold them accountable for introducing new diseases. We already deal with nature's impositions everyday. We do not need to also be battling against humans synthesizing new diseases and introducing them into the population.

Research into and experimentation with disease (both biological and digital) may need to be declared to and registered with the government and forced to be open processes, and the equipment required to carry out such activities may need to be controlled as part of `SovCBIO` law.
